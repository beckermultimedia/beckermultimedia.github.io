	<p>Humaginarium is a place of enchantment in the real world. It is everywhere, yet we can't see or touch it, though we often hear it. Where is this place? Why, it's inside our bodies. It's a world of life under our skin.</p>

	<ul> Here is what you'll discover there:
		<li>Rivers of blood</li>
		<li>Mountains of fleshy tissue</li>
		<li>Oceans and lakes of bodily fluids</li>
		<li>Cities where proteins are manufactured</li>
		<li>And much, much more!</li>
	</ul>
