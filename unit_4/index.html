	<h1>Lofty Adventure Inside the Human Body</h1>

	
	<p>Humaginarium is part museum, part amusement park, part videogame, part terra incognita where biology merges with fantasy and play leads to discovery.</p>
	<p>Humaginarium is where we explore the inside of the human body to learn how it’s arranged, how it works, what it uses and creates to support life. Explorers traverse three dimensions: anatomical, cellular and molecular.</p>
	<p>Make no mistake: a living body is much more than a bag of skin. It’s a physical world within the world of everyday experience: a hidden world that awaits discovery.</p>

	<h1>Expedition Base Camp</h1>
<!-- this is column 1 -->
	<p>Your fantastic trip into the human body begins with selection of an avatar. You’ll decide whether to enter the body of a man or woman, and what kind of person it is.</p>
	<p>Just as people look and act different on the outside, they’re different on the inside depending on gender, age, ethnicity, class and health.</p>
	<p>Each time you play, you may choose a different type of person to enter and explore.</p> 
<!-- this is column 2 -->
	<p>Humaginarium is a virtual, 3D interactive playscape. After choosing your avatar, you’ll enter that character's body on a path of discovery.</p>
	<p>You’ll steer and never get lost. Just click on things that interest you, or things you want to play with.</p>
	<p>Plenty of help is offered along the way. When you want to stop, you can save your location and resume there later.</p>
